# Pocket Cairn Character-Sheet

Cairn is a simple, quick, and classless role-playing game by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/). Game rules can be found on [cairnrpg.com](https://cairnrpg.com). This editor is designed to help you create and manage your character on mobile devices or desktops (with the main focus on using the application on smartphones).

## Why Use Pocket Cairn?

The primary purpose of this application is to empower a Warden (Game Master) to organize role-playing sessions anytime, anywhere. All a player needs to participate is a smartphone. Pocket Cairn allows character creation, management, and even dice rolling. However, the Game Master still needs to be familiar with the rules and have a scenario prepared.

## How and Where Is Data Saved?

All data is stored in your browser's local storage, and you can download it in JSON format at any time. If you're not familiar with JSON, simply avoid making changes to the file. You can upload it to the application on any other device using any browser.

## Instruction

### Main menu

When you open the application page for the first time, you will see the main menu - it contains helpful links and two buttons: roll and upload. The first one opens a form of character creation, and with the second, you can upload a JSON file with character data (it can be downloaded from the application).

### Create a Character

In this form, you can set up a new hero:

- Input or generate a name.
- Swap two of three randomly generated stats.
- Choose starting gear - random or one of the pregenerated packs.

After this, you can save the character and will be ready to play.

### Top Menu

The top menu of the application contains the name of the character and two buttons - by a click, the left one will show you notes, and the right one will show you settings.

### Dice

At the bottom part of the screen, the application has 6 dice buttons - d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d12. By clicking on each of them, buttons will emulate dice roll and generate random results. The last rolled dice will be highlighted by a green blur.

### Charsheet

The main part of the page contains all important information:

- Character attributes that show strong and weak sides of a hero.
- Stats: Hit Protection value, Armor value, and Deprived status.
- Number of gold, silver, and copper pieces that you have.
- Inventory list; to delete an item here, you need to clear the title field.

### Notes

Notes contain information about hero's traits - and you can change it or input other notes here.

### Settings

In the settings section, you can download your character data in JSON format or delete the current character - in this case, all data on your device will be cleared, and you will see the main menu.

Also here you can see the list of scars and a button to add a new scar. Scars are a very interesting Cairn mechanic that helps your character to level up (but only if he's lucky) - you can learn about it in [game rules](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/).

A scar can be added only if damage decreases your HP exactly to 0, and to add it, you must choose how much damage you took in this moment. Some scars resolve immediately, and some after some event - in the second case, you must wait some time and then press the Resolve button; in a good case, you will take some profit from it.
