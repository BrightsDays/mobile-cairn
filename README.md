# Cairn Character-Sheet for Mobile Devices

Cairn is a simple, quick, and classless role-playing game by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/). This editor is designed to help you create and manage your character on mobile devices or desktops (with the main focus on using the application on smartphones).

## Why Use Mobile Cairn?

The primary purpose of this application is to empower a Warden (Game Master) to organize role-playing sessions anytime, anywhere. All a player needs to participate is a smartphone. Mobile Cairn allows character creation, management, and even dice rolling. However, the Game Master still needs to be familiar with the rules and have a scenario prepared.

## How and Where Is Data Saved?

All data is stored in your browser's local storage, and you can download it in JSON format at any time. If you're not familiar with JSON, simply avoid making changes to the file. You can upload it to the application on any other device using any browser.
