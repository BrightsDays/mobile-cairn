Cairn is a simple, quick, and classless role-playing game by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/). Game rules can be found on [cairnrpg.com](https://cairnrpg.com). This editor is designed to help you create and manage your character on mobile devices or desktops (with the main focus on using the application on smartphones).

## Why Use Pocket Cairn?

The primary purpose of this application is to empower a Warden (Game Master) to organize role-playing sessions anytime, anywhere. All a player needs to participate is a smartphone. Pocket Cairn allows character creation, management, and even dice rolling. However, the Game Master still needs to be familiar with the rules and have a scenario prepared.

## How and Where Is Data Saved?

All data is stored in your browser's local storage, and you can download it in JSON format at any time. If you're not familiar with JSON, simply avoid making changes to the file. You can upload it to the application on any other device using any browser.

## Instructions

### First and Second Editions of the Game

Currently we have two editions of the game:

- The first edition is simpler and, in my opinion, better suited for new players.
- The second edition features more complex mechanics and a wider variety of unique character biographies.

You can change the edition of rules for character creation by adjusting the value of the toggle switch on the main page.

With the help of our application, you can convert characters from the first edition to the second edition, but not vice versa.

### Main menu

When you first open the application page, you will be greeted with the main menu. This menu contains helpful links, an edition switch, and three buttons: "Roll," "Convert," and "Upload."

- The "Roll" button opens a form for character creation.
- The "Convert" button allows you to upload a JSON file of a first edition character and convert it to the second edition.
- The "Upload" button enables you to upload a JSON file containing character data, which can be downloaded from the application.

### Top Menu

The top menu of the application contains the name of the character and two buttons - by a click, the left one will show you notes, and the right one will show you settings.

### Dice

At the bottom part of the screen, the application has 6 dice buttons - d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d12. By clicking on each of them, buttons will emulate dice roll and generate random results. The last rolled dice will be highlighted by a green blur.

### Settings

In the settings section, you can download your character data in JSON format or delete the current character - in this case, all data on your device will be cleared, and you will see the main menu.

Here you can see the list of scars and a button to add a new scar. Scars are a very interesting Cairn mechanic that helps your character to level up (but only if he's lucky) - you can learn about it in [game rules](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/).

A scar can be added only if damage decreases your HP exactly to 0, and to add it, you must choose how much damage you took in this moment. Some scars resolve immediately, and some after some event - in the second case, you must wait some time and then press the Resolve button; in a good case, you will take some profit from it.

Also, you can edit the maximum value of any stat: either increase or decrease it. However, this should only be done to resolve a game mechanicâ€”please consult your Warden before making any changes to stats!

After this, you can save the character and will be ready to play.

### Charsheet

The main part of the page contains all important information:

- Character attributes that show strong and weak sides of a hero.
- Stats: Hit Protection value, Armor value, and Deprived status.
- Number of gold, silver, and copper pieces that you have.
- Inventory list; to delete an item here, you need to clear the title field.

### Charsheet

The main part of the page contains all important information:

- Stats: Hit Protection value, Armor value, and Deprived status.
- Number of gold pieces that you have.
- Inventory list and list of petty items; to delete an item here, you need to clear the title field.

### Notes

Notes have three sections:

- "Bio" contains information about the character's background, perks, and bonds. If the character is converted from the first edition, this section will be mostly empty.
- "Notes" houses information about the hero's traits. You can edit this section or add additional notes.
- "Companions" contain lists your henchmen, animals, and carts. When you add a new companion, their stats are generated randomly, but you can modify them for specific scenarios. You must also input the name and type of the companion. If the type is "Transport", stats will not be displayed on the character card, as carts do not have attributes like strength or will.
